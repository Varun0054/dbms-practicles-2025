MySQL Practical S8

Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Companies (
  comp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  cost DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  year INT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  comp_id INT NOT NULL,
  domain VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (comp_id, domain),
  CONSTRAINT fk_orders_companies FOREIGN KEY (comp_id)
    REFERENCES Companies(comp_id)
);
```

Solutions:

1) Inner join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

2) Left outer join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

3) Right outer join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

4) Union example
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id
UNION
SELECT c.name, c.cost, NULL, NULL
FROM Companies c;
```

5) View1: company name and quantities
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW View1 AS
SELECT c.name AS company_name, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

6) View2 (two columns) and I/U/D on base table; 7) Display View1, View2
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW View2 AS SELECT comp_id, name FROM Companies;
SELECT * FROM View1; SELECT * FROM View2;
```

Schema:

```sql
CREATE TABLE Companies (
  comp_id INT PRIMARY KEY,
  name VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  cost DECIMAL(15,2) NOT NULL,
  year INT
);

CREATE TABLE Orders (
  comp_id INT NOT NULL,
  domain VARCHAR(100) NOT NULL,
  quantity INT NOT NULL,
  PRIMARY KEY (comp_id, domain),
  CONSTRAINT fk_orders_companies FOREIGN KEY (comp_id)
    REFERENCES Companies(comp_id)
);
```

Solutions:

1) Inner join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

2) Left outer join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
LEFT JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

3) Right outer join
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
RIGHT JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

4) Union example (combine result sets)
```sql
SELECT c.name, c.cost, o.domain, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id
UNION
SELECT c.name, c.cost, NULL AS domain, NULL AS quantity
FROM Companies c;
```

5) Create View1: company name and quantities
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW View1 AS
SELECT c.name AS company_name, o.quantity
FROM Companies c
JOIN Orders o ON o.comp_id = c.comp_id;
```

6) Create View2 with any two columns and perform I/U/D
```sql
CREATE OR REPLACE VIEW View2 AS
SELECT comp_id, name FROM Companies;

-- Operate on base table for reliability
INSERT INTO Companies (comp_id, name, cost, year) VALUES (1001,'X Corp',5000,2020);
UPDATE Companies SET name = 'X Corporation' WHERE comp_id = 1001;
DELETE FROM Companies WHERE comp_id = 1001;
```

7) Display content of View1, View2
```sql
SELECT * FROM View1;
SELECT * FROM View2;
```

Note: RIGHT JOIN support depends on MySQL version; modern MySQL supports it.
