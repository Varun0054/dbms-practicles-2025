# DBMS Practicals 2025

Collection of MySQL, PL/SQL, and MongoDB practical solutions derived from the provided problem statements.

## Structure
- S1..S9: MySQL schema and query solutions
- P1..P10: PL/SQL blocks, procedures, functions, and triggers
- M1..M3: MongoDB CRUD/query tasks
- C1..C2: Connectivity outlines (MongoDB, MySQL)
- data.txt: Problem statements (consolidated)
- prompt.txt: Series/order reference

## Usage
- MySQL: Run SQL blocks in your MySQL client (adjust engine/version specifics if needed).
- PL/SQL: Execute in Oracle-compatible environment (SQL*Plus/SQL Developer). Blocks are delimited with `/`.
- MongoDB: Run JavaScript snippets in `mongosh`.

## Notes
- Views and triggers may require privileges and version support.
- Sample constraints and data types are suggested; adjust to your environment.
- Some tasks include outlines rather than full apps (see C1/C2 examples).
